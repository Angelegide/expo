description: Learn how to use variables in Workflows.

You can use variables in your workflows to pass data between jobs or steps. Variables are useful for conditionals on subsequent jobs or afftecting the output of a workflow.

You can set variables in the workflow file with the `set-output` function:

```yaml .eas/workflows/variables.yaml
jobs:
  fingerprint:
    outputs:
      # @info Sets the `fingerprint_hash_for_workflow` as a variable #
      fingerprint_hash_for_workflow: ${{ steps.fingerprint_step_id.outputs.fingerprint_hash }}
      # @end #
    steps:
      - name: Set fingerprint hash
			id: fingerprint_step_id
			run: |
				FINGERPRINT_HASH=$(npx expo-updates fingerprint:generate --platform ios | jq '.hash')
                # @info Sets the `fingerprint_hash` as a variable #
				set-output fingerprint_hash $FINGERPRINT_HASH
                # @end #
                # @info Exposes the `fingerprint_hash` variable to other steps in this job #
			outputs: [fingerprint_hash]
                # @end #
      - name: Do something with the fingerprint hash
			run: |
                # @info Accesses the `fingerprint_hash` variable #
				echo ${ steps.fingerprint_step_id.outputs.fingerprint_hash }
                # @end #
    maybe_build:
      needs: [fingerprint]
      # @info Accesses the `fingerprint_hash_for_workflow` variable #
      if: ${{ needs.fingerprint.outputs.fingerprint_hash_for_workflow != '1234' }}
      # @end #
      type: build
      params:
        platform: ios
```

In the example above, three things are happening:

- The `set-output` function sets the `fingerprint_hash` variable.
- The `outputs` keyword on the step inside the `fingerprint` job exposes the `fingerprint_hash` variable to other steps in `fingerprint` job. That variable is used in an `echo` statement later in the job.
- The `outputs` keyword on the `fingerprint` job specifies that the whole workflow will have access to a variable called `fingerprint_hash_for_workflow`. That variable is later used in the `maybe_build` job to conditionally run the build job.
